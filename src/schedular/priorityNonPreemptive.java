/*Purpose: Implements the actual non-preemptive priority scheduling algorithm.

Accepts:

A list of processes, each with arrival time, burst time, and priority.

Sorts them based on:

Arrival time (first).

Priority (next) — lower number = higher priority.

Simulates CPU execution:

Selects the next process that has arrived and has highest priority.

Runs it fully (non-preemptive).

/* 
Calculates for each process:

Waiting Time = start time − arrival time

Turnaround Time = completion time − arrival time

Response Time = start time − arrival time

Returns:

Updated list of processes (with times filled in).

Averages for Waiting, Turnaround, and Response Times
